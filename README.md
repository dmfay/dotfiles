# hi

These are my dotfiles. I run Arch Linux with i3wm primarily, and have done some customization of OSX with kwm/khd too. Everything in here can be safely assumed to be in flux to a greater or lesser extent.

Most of the cool and/or useful stuff in here is in the i3, zsh, and vim/neovim configuration, unless you're really into bare-bones dunst configs or what have you.

## installation

Execute `install`. This uses `install.conf.yaml` by default, which sets up for Arch. `install -c osx.conf.yaml` uses the OSX configuration.
